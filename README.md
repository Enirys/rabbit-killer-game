Rabbit Killer is a game I created during the GMTK 2019 Game Jam.
The theme of the jam at that time was "Only One". This game was created using Unity3D game engine and C#. The 3D art assets were created using Blender3D.
If you want to test the game you can follow this link: https://enirys.itch.io/rabbit-killer
Game description
Only one of them is Killer Bunny, he used some magic and other stuff to disguise himself as a normal bunny. Find him before he eats all the other bunnies!
Controls: Use your mouse to select killer bunny when you find him :D
